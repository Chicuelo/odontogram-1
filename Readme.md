##Introduction

I started to make this library in 2010, but html5 was so young and unstable.
So nowadays we have Fabric.js, AngularJS and more great technologies
that make this possible. This is for my future wife... April! (UPDATE she's my wife now!).

Currently working on code and docs.


##Note: In this moment, I'm not integrating any change, please be patient, it's almost done :P
